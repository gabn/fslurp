Introduction
============
fslurp is a program to pull the data from a Fronius inverter systems
via a serial port connection.

It supports both single and multiple inverter systems through the
Interface Card Easy and the Fronius Interface Card/DataLogger Box. Fronius
Sensor Card devices are also supported.

It supports both human-readable and delimited (CSV-style) text output.

Sample output can be seen by building project and exercising one
of the test simulator targets (e.g. simIFCEasy).

It is written in C++ and has been compiled on Linux.

Building
========

The GNU C++ compiler and the GNU make program
are required for building fslurp.

Un-tar the source.
cd to the top level directory extracted.
Type make to build.

Installing and running
======================

The fslurp binary requires no external files and can be run
from anywhere.  Copy it to wherever is appropriate.

Testing
=======

In addition to fslurp, the makefile builds several simulator versions
of fslurp (e.g. simIFCEasy). The simulators are identical to fslurp,
except that they each replace the serial communications simulated canned
responses for a particular Fronius installation configuration.

The test target in the makefile exercises fslurp via these simulators.
